# SpaceBirds satellite tracker #
This is a satellite tracker built on top of the Web WorldWind API.
The deployable web app is stored in the /standalone directory.
/standalone/SatTracker.html should launch the application.

The rest of the folders are forked from the WebWorldWind NASA repository
and are kept as reference and to provide a way to build the worldwindlib.js library

For instructions on how to obtain an updated version of worldwindlib.js, see "GruntSetup.txt"

This is an alpha version.
